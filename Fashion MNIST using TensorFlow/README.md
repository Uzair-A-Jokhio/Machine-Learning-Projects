## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a simple clothing classification model using TensorFlow and the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify images of various clothing items into predefined categories. The code showcases key steps in the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The clothing classification model is a sequential neural network composed of layers:

1. Input Layer: Flattens the 28x28 pixel images into a 1D array.
2. Hidden Layer 1: Dense layer with 512 neurons and ReLU activation.
3. Hidden Layer 2: Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
4. Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons (representing the 10 clothing categories) and softmax activation.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.
